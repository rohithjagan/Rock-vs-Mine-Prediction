# 🪨 Rock vs Mine Prediction

A **Machine Learning classification project** that predicts whether a detected underwater object is a **Rock** or a **Mine (explosive)** using sonar signal data.  
This project applies supervised learning techniques to analyze frequency patterns and make accurate binary predictions.

---

## Overview

The **Sonar (Mines vs Rocks)** dataset contains 60 numerical features representing sonar signal strengths bounced off metal cylinders and rocks.  
The objective is to build a model that can distinguish between **mines** (metal objects) and **rocks** (natural objects) based on these reflected sonar signals.
